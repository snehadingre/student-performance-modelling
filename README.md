_Academic background factors_ : Educational stages, grade, levels, course topic

_Behavioral factors_ : Raised hand, visited resources, discussion groups, etc.

_Demographic factors_ : Nationality, gender, place of birth, etc.

- Use EDA to analyze how each of the factors in above mentioned categories contribute individually to student's academic performance as well as finding correlation between factors.

- View feature importance of variables and build a predictive model using Decision Tree to predict a student's performance based on these factors.

- Evaluating performance of the model developed.

#### Libraries used: plyr, ggplot2, moments, cluster, randomForest
